         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Lo ſiſter all this before is ſayd
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:9955:19"/>moche of bocall prayer, &amp; lytell of mentall pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers. For euer amonges all gooſtly exercyſes prayer is a holy meane.

And yf medy<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tacion haue chefe occupacion, than prayer bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth out among. And therfore in as moch as it is longyng to prayer, ſomwhat ſhall I ſay of mentall prayer, whiche is called medytacion. And alſo for to ſtyre the whan thou arte alone, how thou ſhalte be occupyed in medytacion.</p>
                  <p>¶ Syſter, ſuche mentall prayer by medytaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is ryght ſwete, merytorious, and precyous to a deuout ſoule / but right few vſe it, and that is pyte. And as ſaynt Hue ſayth in a boke whi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>che he maketh of the maner of ſuche medytaty<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ue prayer, that ſuch prayers is called deuocio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, purely of the ſoule, which is a very tornyng in to god, by meke and mylde affection, By this y<hi rend="sup">u</hi> mayſt knowe that medytacion ſholde be meke, by conſyderacyon of hym that ſo prayeth. Of this we fynd a good example by the publycane in the goſpell, whiche in his herte prayed. ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myttyng thy ſelf (mekely to god) a very ſyn<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>er. ſayeng outward by right fewe wordes. as for vocal prayers, whan he ſayd thus. Deus pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>picius
<pb facs="tcp:9955:20"/>eſto michi peccatori. For all his pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers were inward for the moſte parte. All ſuche that praye by medytacion, they ſpeake fewe wordes. In other properte meditatiue prayer hathe: yt is ſhorte, as ſhort wordes of loue or of mercy, and ſendith out his flames and bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes Such a ſhort medytatyf prayer ſiſter per<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ceth heuen. For all ſuche ſoules that ſo ben occu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pyed in meditacions, done reſt in god, as in the begynnyng &amp; endyng of his medytacyon. And thus ſuche medytatife prayer is ſhort. Not for the ſhortneſſe of deuocion, but for the ſhortneſſe of the length in wordes. Another properte that longeth vnto medytatyue prayer, that is deſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous by waylyng, ſobbyng, and ſyghing, to be with our lorde. So that ſuche one may ſay w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the ꝓphete Dauyd. thus.

                        <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He fyrſt fruyt of this holy tree is called Charite. Cha<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rite is a coupling of the ſou<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>le with god, whiche is the lyfe of the ſoule. For lyke as a naturall dethe depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth the ſoule from the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, ſo gooſtly dethe byſyfie departeth the ſoule from god. The holi doctour ſaynt Auguſtyn ſayth that there is a very deth which that mendrede but lytel, and that is the departyng of the ſoule fro almyghty god. God is the blyſſed lyfe of ſoules, for by charyte be lo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ued all that ought to be loued as vertue, and all that ought to be hated as vyces. Good ſiſter eat oft of this precyous fruyte of charyte, for it is ryght precyous, in as moche as it is the pryce for to haue the kyngdome of heuen. And it is ſo
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:9955:26"/>precyous a fruyt that w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>out that, man is of noo pryce in the ſyght of god, as ſaynt Paul ſayth. i. Cor xiii. Si charitatem aute<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> non habeo, nihil ſum. <g ref="char:leaf">❧</g> Alſo (he ſayth) al the werkes that we done without it be of no value. Saynt Gregory ſayth. As the braunches of a tree come out of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> rote, ſoo all vertues ſpryngeth out of Charyte, She is mother of all vertues, and norſe. For a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore her was no vertue, and without her is no vertue merytoryous. She informeth and gy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth ſtrength to all vertues, that they may be acceptable to god. without charyte may no ſou<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>le be ſafe nor pleaſe god. Charyte longeth to all folke, and namely to relygious. which ſhold be more parfyte than the comyn people. ☞ what profyte is it ſyſter to profeſſe hygh lyuyng, and in habyte to ſhewe parfeccyon yf we endeuor vs not to lerne vertue and exerciſe it in dede? It is a great ſhame to vs (and rather worthy pay<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ne than mede) to profeſſe or promyt great thyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and do the leeſt. Therfore yf we be in chari<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>te we ſhall thynke hard thy<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ges lyght and eaſy. <g ref="char:leaf">❧</g> Now ꝑadue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ture thou woldeſt wyte what is this worthy fruyt of charyte, that I ſpeake of? To this I anſwere and ſay y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> charyte is an ordynate and well dyſpoſed wyll to ſerue god, to pleaſe god, and to haue fruycion &amp; vſe of god. Charyte and loue is all one. Charyte is ſuche a
<pb facs="tcp:9955:27"/>ſouerayne vertue that it ioyneth &amp; coupleth to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gider the louer and the loued. For mekeneſſe ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>keth vs ſwete vnto almyghty god. Pouerte ioy<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>neth, and blyſſed charyte maketh vs one with god. Charyte is fayreſt of all vertues. Charyte is a thyng by the which god loueth vs, and we god, &amp; eueryche of vs other. Charite is a deſyre of the hert, euer thynkyng on that, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> it loueth. And whan it hath that it loueth than it ioyeth, &amp; nothyng may make it ſory. Charyte is an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſyre betwene two w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> laſting of thoughtes. Charite is a ſtrength of the ſoule to loue god for hym ſelf, and other thinges for god, and in god. which charyte whan it is ſo ſet in god, it dooth away all inordynate loue. And ſo charyte put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth away deedly ſyn<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e, for it is the richeſt affec<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cyon of mannes ſoule. Charyte is the fruyte of trouthe, ſtablynge of wyttes and of connynge. Se how good charyte is. who wolde forſake that bliſſed fruyt whiche is ſo good? If we ſuf<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fre to be ſlayne, yf we gyue all that we haue yf we knowe as moche as men may in erthe, all this without charite is nothyng els but ſorow and torment. Charyte is a very true turnynge from all erthly thynges, and a ioynynge to god without departynge, kyndled with the fyre of the holy gooſt, fer from the fylthy fyre of carnal corrupcyon, ſubiect to no deedly vyces, but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reyſed
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:9955:27"/>vp aboue all fleſſhely luſtes, euer redy &amp; gredy to contemplacyon. Charyte is alſo the fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne of all good affeccyons, helth of good maners, dethe of ſynnes, lyfe of vertues, without whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che may no man pleaſe god. with it man deuout<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly ſeruethgod. Very charyte clenſeth the ſoule and delyuereth it from the paynes of helle, and out of the felawſhyppes of deuylles, and ſoone maketh it the ſeruaunt of god, parte takers of the herytage of heuen. ☞ Lo ſyſter, in ſuche lo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ue and charyte thou muſt enforce the to be ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yed and clothed, as yron and ſtele is clothed in fyre whan it brenneth as fyre. And as the ayre or the fyrmament is clothed in the ſon<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e whan it ſhyneth as lyght. <g ref="char:leaf">❧</g> O blyſſed be all they y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> be ſo turned all in to fyre and ſhynynge heate of charyte in euery proſperyte, and in all aduerſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te. Suche charite maketh a deuout ſoule for to deſyre for to be loſed out of this wretched lyfe, and be endleſly with god. All ſuche liue in great pacience by tedious abydyng of the deth euery daye and euery houre deſyryng a departyng of the body &amp; the ſoule by naturall deth, ye though they were hard tormentes and paſſyons. Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che charite made ſaynt Andrew for to halſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyrouſly the deth of the croſſe. And ſaynt Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to pray deuoutly for them the whiche ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned him to deth, by the which he ſe into heuen
<pb facs="tcp:9955:28"/>that he had longe before deſyred. It made alſo ſaynt Laure<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce to ſcorne his tormentours, ſaint Vincent to haſte his tormentors faſt, for to put hym to his deth. Saynt Agate gladly and ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to go to her paſſion, as though ſhe had ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byd and deſyred to a great feaſt, and other glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous martyrs to ioy in theyr tribulacions, and to loue theyr enemys which purſued them, by the whiche they were ſtyrred to deſyre moſt ha<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtyly heuenly ioye and blyſſe which they loued here in erth. Netheleſſe though charite be ſo fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent, that it maketh a ſoule to deſyre departy<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g out of this worlde, yet the ſame charyte is ſoo kyndled with the loue of goo that it ſtyryth vs to abyde here after his wyll though it be payn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to vs, in aſmoche we may not here haue co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pyouſe plente in vſe of that blyſſed welle of lyfe Ieſu chryſt, yet by his blyſſed grace in the mea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ne tyme of all our deſyrous abydyng here after his wyll, he noryſheth vs &amp; conforteth vs with in great confortes, as it were by the .iii. heuen<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly droppes of gooſtly graces. One is, by inwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dely recreacyon of the blyſſed ſacrament of the aultre, whan we receyue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bliſſed body, which is to all deuout folke a ſynguler confort for rele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyng of the tedious deſyre of this wretched ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yle, for therin they receyue veryly and holſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hym, whome they beſt loue, oure lorde Ieſu
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:9955:28"/>Chryſt. Another is by multyplyeng of gooſtly fruyt, that is in ſekyng the encreaſe of other for to multyply the nombre of ſaued ſoules to the worſhyppe of god. By ſuche gooſtly multyply<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>yng, they ſuffre more eaſely the euyls of thys preſent exyle. The thyrd is for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> preſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des chyldren with whome they be in a maner conforted of the blyſſe of heuen here in erth, for as moche as they ſe ſuche encreaſe in charyte &amp; loue of vertue, though ſuche a ſoule by fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent charyte mourne for the blyſſe of heuen in deſyre for to be loſed out of this wretched exyle and be with her ſpouſe Ieſu, yet ſom gladnes ſhe hathe for to abyde, namely for the ſwetnes that ſhe fyndeth in receyuynge here of our lor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des bleſſid body. In the turnyng of ſynners to vertue, and in the profyt and increaſe of lyuers and ſo this exyle is the more tollerable, in that it is more fruytfull. For albe it y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſuche a mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyng ſoule in charite come late to her ſpouſe Ie<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſu, yet ſhe hopith to come &amp; bryng many w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> her. Thus by ſuche charite was ſaynt Paul coar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for to abyde in this wretched world betwe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ne deſyre of loſyng for to be with god, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fytable increaſe of his ſubiectes. Of ſuche pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fytable encreaſe he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>forted hym ſelfe betwene whyles agaynſt his tedyous delay frome the kyngdome of heuen, ſayeng thus. Philip .i.
<pb facs="tcp:9955:29"/>Coartor enim eduobus deſideriu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> habens diſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſolui, et eſſe cum chriſto multo melius ꝑmanere in carne neceſſarium eſt propter vos. That is. I am coarted &amp; anguyſſhed in my ſelfe of two thyuges. One is, I deſyre to be vnloſed out of my deadly body and be with chriſt, &amp; that we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re right paſſyng good to me. An other is. I wo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>te well yt is ryght neceſſary to abyde in my bo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dely lyfe only for you, of theſe two I know not which I may rather choſe. Lo ſiſter what ſwe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>te frute charite is. Thus frute of charite ſhuld euer be in thy hart, and in thy wyll, not only in thy dedes, but alſo in thy ſoule. Many ſpekith charitably and doth charitably, but yet they lo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ue nother god nor be in charyte, as ypocrytes whiche ſuffren greate penaunce and ſeme holy to the ſight outward, but by cauſe thy ſeke out<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ward worſhyp and prayſyng, &amp; fauour, they haue loſt theyr mede, whan a man gyuith him to penaunce and to pouerte, and dothe great al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes dedes, it is a token he is in charite, yet he is neuer y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> more in charite for that alone, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out more. But whan he forſakyth the worlde only for goddes loue, &amp; ſettyth all his thoughte to good, and is in charite with all folke, and all good dedes that he may do, he dothe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in that intent for to pleaſe our lorde Ieſu, and to com to the blyſſe of heuen, than he is in very charyte,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:9955:29"/>and that charite is in the ſoule, for ſo his dedes ſhewith outwarde. If thou therfore ſyſter ſpe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ke good, &amp; do good, folke that herith y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſo ſpeke &amp; do, wene y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> thou art in charite, for they wene thy wordes and thy dedes accordyth with thy ſoule in god, els thou art a deceyuer of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and dampneſt thy ſoule. Lo ſyſter thus cha<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rite is in wyll veryly, not in werke only, for in werke only it is a token of charite, but he that ſayth that he is in charyte, and wyll not do in dede that in hym is for to ſhew loue, truely he is not in charite as ſaynt Iohn<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſayth. For cha<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rite is neuer ydel, it is euermore workyng ſom good. And yf it ceaſe of workynge know right wel it waſtyth a way, what is very workyng of loue and charite? Truely very loue and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite, is to loue god with all thy ſtrength mygh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyly, with all thy hert wyſely, w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> all thy ſoule deuoutly &amp; ſwetly, wylt thou be in loue &amp; chari<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>te myghtely.

Thus mayſt thou ſe that yf thou be wyſely in loue and charite, thou muſt loue laſtyng thyng laſtingly, paſſyng thyng paſſyngly / ſo that thy herte be ſet and faſtened in nothyng but in god, or for god charytably. Thou muſt alſo not only be in loue and charyte myghtely and wyſely, but alſo ſwetly &amp; deuoutly. Swete loue &amp; cha<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rite is whan thy body is chaſt, &amp; thy thought
<pb facs="tcp:9955:31"/>clene. Of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> whiche chaſtite by the grace of god I purpoſe to wryte in the laſt ende of this trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyſe, as for the .xii. fruyte of euery gooſtly ſou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le.

Of this gooſtly ioye I purpoſe for to wryte in the next gooſtly fruyte of euery gooſtly ſoule. Nowe wylt thou knowe whan thou arte in loue and charyte. Truely ſyſter there is none in erthe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> knoweth whan he is in charyte, but ſuche y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> be inſpyred or haue ony ſpecyall grace which god hath gyuen to him for to knowe it by, of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> whi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>che all other may take example.

Neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe certayne tokens there be, by the which thou mayſt knowe yf y<hi rend="sup">u</hi> be in charyte. ☞ Fyrſt is whan all couetyſe of erthly thynges is quen<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ched in the. For where y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> couetyſe is, there is no charite nor loue of god. the loue of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> one putteth out the other. The ſecond token is hertely deſy<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rynge
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:9955:31"/>in all tymes eatyng and drynkyng, wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kyng and ſleping of heuen blyſſe. Yf thou be ſet in loue and charyte ſyſter, that thou canſt fynd no ioye in this lyfe, it is a token that thou arte in charyte. And the more thou ſauoureſt of he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen the more thou deſyreſt it. The thyrd token is chaungynge of thy tongue. For yf thy to<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gue be chaunged whiche was wonte (peraduentu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>re) to ſpeke of erthly thynges, nowe ſpeketh of god and of heuenly thinges, it is a token that y<hi rend="sup">u</hi> arte in charyte.

And yet than euer caſt vp thyn hert to heuen in all ſuche beſyneſſe. The fyfth is whan all harde thyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges ſeme lyght to the / and y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> maketh charyte. The ſyxte is, whan thou ſuffreſt all a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>guyſſhes and hurtes mekely.

This ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth wel y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> thou arte in charite. ¶ Many the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re be ſyſter that can loue god, and be in charyte whan they be in reſt and eaſe, but in aduerſyte they doo grudge, and be ſorowfull. and be thro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen

That is a great wretched<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, that ony aduerſite ſholde make him for to grudge agaynſt goddes wyl. But that is a bleſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſyd charyte that no violence of ſorow may put away. Good ſyſter loue well charite and theſe tokens of charite. Syſter thou art callyd to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lygion for to be a louer of charite. Foure maner ky<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des of louers of charite be there in relygion. The fyrſt is a begyn<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>yng louer, the ſeconde is a growyng louer, the thyrde is a parfyt louer, &amp; the fourth is a moſte parfyt louer. The fyrſt lo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ue is newe borne, the ſeconde loue is noryſſhed in growyng, the thyrde loue is myghty &amp; well ſtrengthed, and the fourth is lowly abydynge his departynge out of this wretched worlde. Of theſe foure degres of charite our lorde ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth in holy ſcrypture, where as he makyth a ſymylytude of corne ſowen in the grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de.

After that it appereth as full corne in the eare, and than it abydyth nothynge els but harueſt, for to be ledde into the barne. Yf thou be yet but tendre in loue &amp; charite, ſo that ofte tymes thou fyndeſt thy ſelfe frayle to falle out therof lyght<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly by the leaſte blaſt of temptacyon or ſtyrynge
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:9955:32"/>of other, thou art yet but an herbe whiche ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyth moche kepyng that it be not deſtroyed by beaſtes, that is by beaſtly lyuynge, more after the body then after y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſoule, and ſo with ſad goo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtly lyuyng it wyll growe man eare of mygh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier ſtrength that thou may ſuffre to be wedin by ſharp rebukyng &amp; reproues, if it nede.

This garner deſyred y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> charytable corne ſaynt Paule whan he ſayd. Cupio diſſolui et eſſecum xp<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>o. Phi .i.

                        <pb facs="tcp:9955:33"/>Chryſt. Suche charyte is ſtronge as dethe as Salomo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſayth. Cant .viii. Fortis eſt vt mors dilectio. For ryght as dethe dooth to the body, ſo dooth loue to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſoule. Deth departeth a man fro bodyly luſtes, and fro worldly bytterneſſe. It maketh hym neyther fele cryenges nor we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pynges, nor beatynges. Ryght ſo doth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> loue to the ſoule. It departeth the ſoule fro y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> lykyng of all erthly thinges, &amp; maketh it heuenly. And what euer it hereth in erthe of worldſly noyſes it is ſo rauyſſhed in loue y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it hereth nor felyth it not. Now is ſuche charyte (ſyſter) an holſome fruyte for to vſe, &amp; namely for relygious folke / for it hath .iiii. vertues. One is, who ſo eateth therof it healeth his gooſtly infyrmyte. For he y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is in charyte he is dyſpoſed to all godlyneſſe. Euery thyng ſauoreth to ſuche one as it ought for to ſauour, erthly thing vyle, &amp; gooſtly thing fayre / worſhypes / riches / and worldly power and ſuch other that ſeme worthy &amp; precious in the ſyght of worldly people, ſeme in the ſyghte of gooſtly ſoules right foule. And if relygious people whiche ſhold be gooſtly, ſet moche by ſu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>che dignityes, they haue a great gooſtly ſycke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, for they lacke charite, whiche ſhold hyde &amp; put away all fylthynes. Alſo ſuche charite put<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>teth away &amp; hydeth our offences to god. Of the whiche hydyng ſpeketh Salomon. Prouer .x.
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:9955:33"/>Uniuerſa delicta operit caritas. All treſpaces and all offe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces charyte putteth away, as it had neuer ben he ſayth. For as ſaynt Bernarde ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yeth. whan our lorde forgyueth our ſynnes he forgyueth them fully and mercyfully, not dam<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>puyng by vengeaunce / not ſhamyng vs by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proues / nor leſſe louynge vs by vpbraydynge. And yf our lorde neuer vpbrayde vs of our ſyn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nes that we haue doone. it is as it neuer had be in his ſyght. Lo ſyſter how this fruyte of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryte hydeth bothe our inwarde gooſtly ſynnes &amp; our outwarde bodyly ſynnes, as they had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ben. The ſecond vertue of this fruyte of cha<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rite is, that it maketh man wyſe as Salomon ſaith. Eccl. i. Dilectio dei honorabilis ſapie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tia. The loue of god (he ſayth) is a worſhipful wyſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dome. Thou art not very wyſe but yf y<hi rend="sup">u</hi> cheriſh derely all gooſtly good thynges. For right as he were no wyſe marchaunt y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wolde gyue golde for fylth, &amp; put it in his cheſt as golde. ryght ſo is he vnwyſe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> loueth better te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>porall goodes y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> be but as fylthe, than gooſtly goodes. Kepe wel this fruyte of charyte ſiſter, &amp; it ſhall teache the to ſet lytell by all worldly thinges. The thyrde vertue of this fruyte of charyte is, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it maketh a man ryche. For charyte is ſo precyous that it is lykened in holy write to pure proued golde in the fyre, as I fynde wryten in the apocalypſe.

The fourth vertue is that it maketh a man lykyng &amp; pleaſau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to god. For whan a ſoule loueth our lorde, our blyſſed lorde wyll loue hym agayne, which paſſeth al other loue. As our lorde ſayth by Salomon. <abbr>Prouerb</abbr> .viii.

                     <head>¶ The ſeconde fruyte of the tree of gooſtly lyuyng is Ioye. Ca. ij.</head>
                     <p>THe ſecond fruyte of the holy gooſt in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly lyuers is called Ioye. Truely Ioye in the holy gooſt, that is gooſtly ioye / not erthly ioye, but for to ioye in god &amp; in hope of endleſſe goodes / and in the grete benefytes of our lorde. All ſuche ioye is for to be glad and ioyfull of the encreaſe of vertue of other, &amp; for to thanke god for them / and for to lothe all vanytees, and for to be quycke and mery gooſtly in dyuyne ſeruy<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ce. This is that fruyte of ioye which I wolde thou eate of, wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> worldly wretched gladneſſe is about to chaunge thy ſoule in to dyſſolucion and banyte. That is whan it wold make the to ioye in affluence of temporall goodes / of laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ynge and ſcornyng of ydle tales and dyſhoueſt playes. And alſo wolde make vnſauery to the al that longeth to godward / as is to be dulle in dyuyne ſeruyce, in beſyneſſe of deuocyon &amp; ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, and ſuche other. All this is no gooſtly ioye but worldly ioyes. It is no very ioye, but vay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne
<pb facs="tcp:9955:35"/>ioye. Goſtly ioye is very ioye, though it be no full ioye. This ioye may none haue. but ſuche y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> be in charyte, &amp; eate therof ſwetely, as I ſayd before in the fyrſt fruyte of charyte. Very chari<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>te axeth very ioye. Of this ioye ſpeketh Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon thus. <abbr>Eccl</abbr> .xxx. Non eſt oblectamentum ſuꝑ cordis gaudiu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. That is, there is no ioye to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ioye of the herte. In thre thynges ioye of herte y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is gooſtly ioye paſſeth all carnall ioyes. Fyrſt is that it is contynuall. An erthly man though he ſyt at a delycate bodyly feaſt, yet at the laſte he ſhall iothe it, be the feaſt neuer ſoo delycate. But a ſure ioyfull ſoule ſet in vertue, is euer as it were at a contynuall feaſt without lothynge. The ſeconde is, that gooſtly ioye is more pure than erthely or carnall ioye. Aglotonous man fyndeth many bitterneſſes annexed to his ioye. One is afflyction and torment within hymſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe of longe delay from his delycates that he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyreth. Another is defaut that he findeth in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whan that they be ſet afore hym / which is not made to his lykynge. And yf that they be made to his lykynge, than he receyueth them ſo luſty<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly ioye / the more it is had, the gladder is the ha<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uer. Neuer wery, nor ſeke of y<hi rend="sup">u</hi> vſe therof. The thyrde is, that carnall ioye is of vyle thynges,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:9955:35"/>&amp; not laſtyng. But ioye of herte is of very good thynges euerlaſtyng. Many thynges I fynde that cauſeth a man to be glad in herte and alſo in godſtly ioye. One is parfyte purete and clen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of conſcyence. A very gentyll ſoule reſteth moche rather in the bedde of a clene conſcyence, than of an vnclene conſcyence. For kyndely the the pure and clene ſoule abhorreth, and hath ab<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>homynacyon of vncleneſſe / and hath right gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te ioye of clenneſſe. As oft as the ſoule is ſyke, ſo often it is vnclene. Sykeneſſe of the ſoule is vnclenneſſe. whan y<hi rend="sup">u</hi> ſoule is hole, that is whan it is in clenneſſe / than it is in reſte and ioye, as Salomon ſayeth in his prouerbes. Prouerbio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum .xvi. Dulcedo anime ſamtas oſſiu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. That is. The ſweteneſſe of the ſoule (he ſayth) that is the clenneſſe of the ſoule is helthe of the boo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes. By theſe bones be vnderſtande gyftes of graces of the holy gooſt, which be myghty and ſtronge as bones, and kepeth the ſoule in ſtren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gthe and vygour. It is not ſo with worldly lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers whiche haue erthely ioye. For theyr ioye is not laſtynge, in as moche as they lacke clen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of theyr conſcience. The ſeconde is the dyſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>chargynge of the burden of euerlaſtynge dethe. whiche all wretched ſynners be charged with. As the holy prophete Dauyd ſayd. Pſ .xxxvii. <g ref="char:leaf">❧</g> Iniquitates mee ſupergreſſe ſunt capud

The wyckedneſſe (he ſayth) of ſynners haue o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerpaſſed theyr heed, for as a greuous burden they be paſſyng greuous aboue hym. Of this all clene ſoules be dyſcharged, for aſmoche as they haue clenſed theyr conſcyence by oft co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>try<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cion, ſo that they fele an herty ioye in god. The thyrde is Fredome of ſoule, for they be not boun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>de in the bo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des of the fende. Who that hath the holy gooſt hath fredome as ſaynt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Paule ſayth it. Cor .iii. Ubi ſpiritus du<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>i ibi libertas.

Thre degrees I fynde of pacience. ¶ The fyrſt degre is y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> a man beſy hym to lerne to repreſſe by ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayle all maner ſtyrynges of wrath and impact<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ence, leſt it breake out by vnlawful wordes &amp; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, but lete it be quenched as fyre in his owne ſmoke, for but yf it be reſtreyned it wyll encres<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſe and growe and brenne all that cometh nygh. In .iiii. maner wyſe I fynde that fyre is quen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched. One is by water, another is by ſtopping, the thyrde is by waſtyng, and the fourth is for faut of mater. In the ſame wyſe the fyre of im<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pacyence muſt be quenched. Fyrſt by ſhedynge of water, that is by wyſe councell, for to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyſed what we ſay. And thynk how moch pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fyte is in pacyence, and how moche harme co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth of impacyence. The ſecond is by ſtopping that is by kepyng and ſtoppyng of thy mouthe
<pb facs="tcp:9955:53"/>&amp; thy handes, leſt thy tongue in ſpeking do bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke out in to wordes of falſneſſe, and thy handes in to dedes of fury and haſtyneſſe. The thyrde is by waſtyng, that is by tournyng maters of pre and wrathe in to other maters. For as fyre is quenched by withdrawing of wood eche fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> other, ſo maters of wrath by withdrawyng of the maters wiſely into other maters that may helpe to peas. The fourth is by defaute of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, that is, yf all pryue rownynges be put a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, than all occaſyons of impacyence ſholde ceaſe. Preuy rownyng is a ſubtyll ſuggeſtyon whiche is the greateſt cauſe of debate, yf there be no herers there ſhall no rowners be. ¶ The ſecond degre of pacyence is, that a man by long vſe of pacyence / &amp; in refrynynge of impacye<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce hath ſo lerned y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he is not afrayd nor trobled for ony aduerſyte, but hym ſemeth y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he is in a pla<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ce of ſuch great ſykerneſſe &amp; reſt, where be ſeeth his aduerſaryes go beſyly about hym for to diſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>eaſe hym, &amp; yet he truſteth verily y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they ſhal do hym no harme, for bycauſe he feleth ſoo greate ſweteneſſe in pacyence. Lo ſyſter, ſo longe is a man aferde of aduerſyte, as longe as he loueth te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>porall thynges, eyther in hiſelf or out of hym ſelf, which he dredeth to loſe, or els hath ſorow in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> loſſe, as is in hurting or loſyng of his own body, his worſhip, his godes, his fre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des, &amp; his
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:9955:53"/>owne wyll. Yf he loue not theſe thynges inordy<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>natly, nor haue no great delite in them, than he hath no great ſorow in the loſſe of them. What harme may our aduerſary do to vs? wherfore ſholde we be ſory? If he hate vs, his own euyl is incloſed in his owne hert, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it may not touch vs, nor do vs no harme. it is his own payn alo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne, be we in peas w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>in our ſelf, &amp; pray for him. A fyre incloſed in another mafies boſome bren<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>eth him and not vs. If he ſay ony worde that ſhold be agaynſt vs, it is but a wynd that paſſeth by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ayre, it hurteth vs not. For lyke as y<hi rend="sup">u</hi> woldeſt not be ſory, but well apayd yf a darte were pyc<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ked or throwen to the and touched the not, but rafie in to the ayre, ſo do of ſuch curſed wordes. for it is but a barkyng and no bytyng. If he bac<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>byte the in thy abſence, yet be y<hi rend="sup">u</hi> not troubled, he hurteth hymſelf &amp; not the.

Therfore pacience is called by doctours the roote and the keper of all vertues. For our lorde ſayth. <abbr>Luc.</abbr> xxi. In pacientia veſtra poſſidebitis animas veſtras. In your pacyence (he ſayeth) ye ſhall kepe in true poſſeſſyo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> your ſoules, that is in reſt and peas. The fruyt of ſuch pacyence hath .iiii. fayre vertues.

Another is, for becauſe we pray not and aſke not in our prayers feruently &amp; deuout<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly that we deſyre. Of this the prophet ſayeth thus. Hie. xxix. Orabitis et exaudiam vos cu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

<pb n="36" facs="tcp:9955:59"/>(ſayeth our lord) and I ſhall here you, namely whan you ſeke me in all your hert, and not els The thyrd is for becauſe we perſeuer not &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tynew in our prayers tyll we haue that we de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſyre. Of this our lord ſayeth thus. <abbr>Luc.</abbr> xi Si perſeueraueris pulſans propter inprobitatem ſurget &amp; dabit. If thou co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tynew in prayers be ſely knockyng, at the laſt he ſayeth I muſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des graunt thyne aſkyng for thy great impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunite that thou makeſt to me. ¶ The fourth why we be not herd anone is, for becauſe we pray doubty<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g and without any great truſt. Of the which y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> holy apoſtle ſaynt Iames ſayth. <abbr>Iacob.</abbr> i. Si quis veſtrum heſitat non eſtimet quod aliquid accipiat. He that doubteth in his prayers, lete none ſuche ſuppoſe that he ſhall haue his aſkynge. Therfore we ſholde not tem<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pre oure lorde to our wylles, for to wyte why<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he wyll graunte vs that we demaunde or not. But we ſholde tempre our ſoules vnto his wyll afore we do praye that whyther he wyll graunt vs or not. His wyll be fulfylled and not ours. ¶ The fyfth why we be not herde is, for it is not dyſcretely, and wyſely aſked that we pray for, but hurtfull to vs. As the chyldren of zebedee, whiche aſked nothyng for theyr helth and therfore it was not grauuted vnto them. <g ref="char:leaf">❧</g> The blyſſed apoſtle ſaynt Iames ſayeth.
<pb facs="tcp:9955:60"/>Iaco. iiii. Detitis et non accipietis eo <abbr>qd</abbr> male petatis. Ye aſke &amp; ye ſhall not haue that ye aſke for as moche as ye aſke not well. In ſuche aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kynges ſiſter though thou wepe and ſobbe for to haue thyn aſkynge, as is for to aſke to be fay<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>re / ſemly / worldely wyſe / and ſuche other, our lorde wyl not here the, for it is not for thy helth The .vi. cauſe why we be not herd in our pray<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ers anon, is that whan we haue our deſire, we ſhold kepe yt wyſely, that ſo longe and with ſo great hardneſſe hathe be deſyred. ☞ Lo here mayſt thou ſe two great profytes in longe aby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng. One is that wanton pride ſhold be repreſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſed in that that we be humbled and made meke in our tarye<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g, and another that the gift which our lorde gyueth vs better than we can deſyre ſhold be made moch of, and not to be ſet lytel by. The ſeuenth cauſe why we be not herd anon in our prayers of our lorde, is becauſe our lorde wyll delay and defer our deſyre and peticion vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>to a more conuenient tyme, for our profyt, than if we had it anon. So Moyſes whan he deſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ioye of god to be ſhewed vnto hym, he had not anon his deſyre, but it was delayed that he ſe it afterward. The eyght cauſe why we be not anon herd in our prayers of our lorde is, for becauſe our lorde wold be ſought helpe of other to pray for vs, and helpe vs in our prayer, for
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:9955:60"/>paraduenture that we aſke is a hard thing, or els it is done for to put away our pryde &amp; foule preſu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pcyon that we ſhold haue yf we thought that our lorde dyd ſo moch for vs without help of other. So prayed that holy kyng Ezechie to the holy prophete yſay for to pray for him and all his people. So prayed alſo that deuout ky<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g Ioſias to a holy woman y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> was a propheteſſe, for to pray for hy<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. So alſo prayed ſaynt Paul. Ro. xv. Obſecro vos vt adiuuetis me in or<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>oꝰ vr<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>is vt liberet ab infidelibus qui ſunt in iudea. I pray you (he ſayd) helpe me in your prayers that I may be delyuered from the vnfaythfull people that ben in Iury. ❀ Thus ſyſter in all our nedes we ſhold ren<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e to the remedy of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, not onely for our ſelfe but by help of other, truſtynge more to the prayers of other than to our own. ¶ The .ix. cauſe is why we haue not that we aſke in our prayers of our lorde. For ꝑ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aduenture that we aſke is not ſo profytable for vs as ſome other thi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g that were more nedefull for vs which we aſke not, which was wel pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ued by ſaynt Paul that aſked one thyng of our lorde, and he had another. He aſked for to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyuered from the ſtyringes of his fleſſhe, for he thought it was foule &amp; not maydenly for to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fre ſuche foule temptacyon, and yet was he not delyuered therof. But our lorde gaue hym ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

So than it is more profitable for vs for to haue ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of trybulacions, than for to be in reſt and quyetneſſe of proſperyte, though we oft deſyre more the one than the other, <g ref="char:leaf">❧</g> Loo ſyſter by this thou mayſt knowe whiche thynges they be that let vs to be herde of god in our prayers.

Abſtinence w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> good workes is moch acceptable to god.

Of this fruyt of continence I fynd .iiii. vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es. One is that it prolongeth the lyfe both bodi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly and gooſtly as Salomon ſayth. <abbr>Eccl</abbr> .xxxvii. Qui abſtinens eſt prolongat vitam. He that is abſtinent lengthyth his lyfe, for if the body be kept fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> corrupcion of gloteny &amp; exceſſe, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſoule is fre from ſyn<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e, &amp; ſo both to lyue at the laſt end<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>leſſy in blyſſe for ſuche abſtinence. The ſeconde vertu is, that it maketh the bodely wantonnes to be repreſſed, for a leane body by abſtine<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, is
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:9955:89"/>co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtrayned for to obey to the ſoule, &amp; leaue wan<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tonnes, As ſaynt Paul ſayth .i. <abbr>Corinth</abbr> .ix.</p>
                     <p>Caſtigo corpus meu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> et in ſeruitute<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> redigo: I chaſtyſe my body (he ſayth) and bryng it vnder in to ſeruitude &amp; bondage vnto the ſoule, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> by ſu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>che chaſtyſyng by abſtynence it may the better ſerue the ſoule &amp; obey therto. The .iii. vertu is y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it gladdeth bothe god &amp; his au<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gels. That this is ſothe I fynd by a figure of Abraham which made a grete feeſt in wynnynge of his chylde. What meneth this wynnyng? Nothi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g els but a departyng from y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſwete mylke of delycates. For our lord hath great ioye of all ſuch that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken all worldly and bodely delytes, as a man wold be of a great feaſt. yf we vſe therfore ſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſly meates &amp; drynkes, we ſhall be kept both cle<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ne in our ſelf, &amp; alſo haue fruicio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; felawſhyp of holy ſay<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes in heuen. The .iiii. vertu is, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> it ke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth a ſoul from y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wicked enemy of luſt which luſt is bitterer than deth. As Salomon ſayth. <abbr>Eccl</abbr> .vii. Inueni amariere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> morti muliere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Lo (he ſayth) I haue fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de a more bitterer enemy than is dethe. And what is y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>? Truly luſt. For luſt ſleeth not onely the body but alſo the ſoule. ¶ Thus ſyſter leaue luſtes in meat / drynke / &amp; ſlepe, and lerne to lyue co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tynently in abſtyne<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce.

Cha<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtyte is the doughter of ſobreneſſe. For ſhe is no ryſſhed of her, lyke as vnclenneſſe by glotony. Syſter it is a great dyfference betwene vyrgy<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nyte &amp; chaſtyte, as it is betwene whytneſſe of kynde and whytneſſe made by craft. The lylly is whyte by kynde, &amp; clothe is made whyte by craft. By the lylly is vnderſtand vyrginite, and by the white cloth is vnderſtand chaſtyle. Vyr<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gynyte is called puryte of ſoule &amp; body afore fal<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lyng, and chaſtyte is called purete of body &amp; ſou<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>le after fallyng. For after long chaſtiſyng of the fleſſhe the ſoule and body is come to whytneſſe &amp; clenneſſe of chaſtyte. Vyrginite hath no ſuche labour, for it groweth and contynueth w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> nege of yeres, &amp; euer is kept hole in whytneſſe vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>

It is not ſo of chaſtyte which I lyken to byce or whyte lynen clothe, made w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> great beſineſſe. Fyrſt the fler therof is grene as graſſe, &amp; than it is dryed. after that beaten, &amp; ſo made clothe. whiche clothe is oft watred &amp; ſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned vnto the tyme it hath taken whytneſſe. So chaſtyte muſt be won<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e and kept. For chaſtyte bereth his name of chaſtyſing. ☞ Firſt who ſo wyll be chaſte &amp; is no vyrgin, he muſt dry vp y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> erthly gren<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>eſſe of lyking &amp; fleſhly luſtes by loth<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>neſſe &amp; hate of ſyn<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e, than for to kepe hm therin, by chaſtyſing or by reaſonable abſtynence and wakinge w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> other bodyly exerciſes.

For lyke as a lylly among thornes groweth vpright without hur<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tyng, ſo dooth worldly chaſte vyrginite among worldly people, thus ſayth Salomon. <abbr>Cant</abbr> .ii. Sicut lilium inter ſpinas, ſic amica mea inter filias. As a lylly ſayth our lorde by Salomon groweth without hurtyng among thornes, ſo doth my deare beloued ſpouſe chaſt virginite a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monge all myne other doughters. The ſeconde vertue is, that chaſt vyrgynite beryth the preci<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ous floure aboue all other maner of chaſtite, be
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:9955:103"/>it of wedlok or of wydowhed. For lyke as one ſterre paſſeth an other in ſhyny<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g in the fyrma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſo doth chaſtite among all the clenneſſe of the erth. The thyrd vertue is, that chaſt vyrgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyte hath the hygh ſeate in heuen next vnto the trinite, in as moche as our blyſſed lady goddes mother that holy virgyn is inhaunſed in blyſſe aboue all the orders of aungels. Therfore glad may all chaſt maydens be, whiche hathe ſo ſpe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ciall a vyrgin nygh the trynite. The fourth ver<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tue is, that chaſt vyrgynite here in erth is moſt next vnto Chryſt bothe bodely and gooſtly.
